# CompSci A-Level NEA
This constitutes 20% of my final grade. I have decided to create a rendering engine from scratch using C# and the WinUI library.

## Primary Objective
My intent is to create a rendering engine that is capable of displaying several 3d shapes at different positions and rotations from the camera. I do this by using a Windows Forms application and individually changing the colour of each pixel based on both the camera's position and the object's position and mesh. An *advanced* goal would be to implement a simple hard lighting engine from several fixed light emitters. In a perfect world, I will be able to achieve a soft lighting engine with shadows and maybe even a rudimentary physics engine. It should be able to run at an FPS rate which is not too jarring for the human eye.

## Shapes to implement
* Sphere
* Cube
* Icosahedron
* Utah Teapot
* [Solemn Vow Bust][1]
* Blender Monkey
